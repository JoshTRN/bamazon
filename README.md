Bamazon is a node app that has three modules. 

The bamazonCustomer.js module allows users to see the products in the bamazon.sql database and purchase them by their ID numbers.

The bamazonManager.js module allows users to see a full product list, see the products which have low inventory and add new products. 

The bamazonSupervisor.js module allows users to add new departments to the bamazon.sql database. It also shows a table in the console by department name that shows the product sales and calculates the profit from the differece between the overhead and the product sales.
